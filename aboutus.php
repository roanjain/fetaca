This was in addition to hitherto existing four Faculties-science, Arts, Fine Arts and Law. The Faculty of Engineering & Technology is duly recognized by the All India Council for Technical Education (AICTE) New Delhi, Ministry of H.R.D. Govt. of India, New Delhi, and affiliated to U.P. Technical University, Lucknow. In the midst of burgeoning growth of private Engineering Colleges, it is a rare distinction for Agra College that the AICTE has granted it permission to establish a Faculty of Engineering & Technology, which underlines our strength and development potential. With respect to infrastructure and engineering education, the faculty is far ahead of the standard and parameters laid down by AICTE.Ever since its inception in 1823, Agra College has enjoyed the singular privilege of wending out to the world, illustrious personalities who have carved out an enviable place in the national and international mainstream.</span></td>
